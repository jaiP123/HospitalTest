Patient Record Management Application

Problem statement
Chinmaya Mission Hospitals are often revered as the best hospitals for the most poor and middle class house holders. With a new set of funds coming in, the CEO of chinmaya mission hospitals has decided to open new branches in various parts of karnataka. However he doesn't have any data to target places that could be most beneficial to people. He has reached out to us to design an application that can record patients' location. He wants to understand, on a given day or for a range of days, how many OP's are within Bangalore and how many are from outside. Based on this he will make a decision if it is feasible to open new branches outside of bangalore or open new Centers within Bangalore itself?
Can you design a program using the oops concept that can record the percentage of local patients vs outstation patients?
Eg: From last 3 days 100 OP registrations took place of which 80% are from bangalore and 20% are outstation.
